# Installing Modernized Runtime Extension (MoRE) 

MoRE provides the capability to continue using traditional WebSphere Application Server (tWAS) Operational Model to manage Java 17 and Java 8 applications within the same traditional WebSphere administrative environment


## 1. Introduction 

Existing WAS ND Clients can run both Java 8 and Java 17 applications using the same operating model. The same WAS Admin Console can be leveraged to manage the environment.

<img src="images/img-00.png">

In the above diagram, the nodes `DMgr Node` and `tWAS Node` are  existing nodes. 

- `DMgr Node` is a Deployment Manager node which runs on Java 8.
- `tWAS Node` is a Server (tWAS) node which runs on Java 8.
- A new node called `MoRE Node` is a `Managed Liberty Server` which runs on Java 17.

To make the existing WAS ND setup into MoRE setup, you may need to do the following.
- Upgrade the WAS ND to WAS ND 9.0.5.23
- Install MoRE
- Install WAS ND Liberty for managed Liberty Server
- Create new node (MoRE node) with managed Liberty Server
- Deploy Java 17 application on top of the new node  (MoRE node).

It is required to have the below servers/software’s  installed and available. Lets install them in the upcoming steps.

## 4. Install the Binaries

**Note:** The installation steps given here are for easy reference. You can update the steps/commands as per your environment.


### 4.1 Upgrade WAS ND 9.0.5.23

Upgrade the existing WAS ND with the fix pack, using the command below.

```
/opt/IBM/InstallationManager/eclipse/tools/imcl install \
