# Installing WAS ND, MoRE and Liberty in Linux (Ubundu)

This document provides step-by-step instructions for installing the following on a Linux machine running on Ubuntu 24.04.
- WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WAS ND) 9.0.5.23 
- MoRE (Modernized Runtime Extension) 1.0.0
- WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment Liberty (WAS ND Liberty) 25.0.0.3

## 1. About MoRE (Modernized Runtime Extension)

MoRE provides the capability to continue using `traditional WebSphere Application Server (tWAS)` Operational Model to manage `Java 17` and `Java 8` applications within the same traditional WebSphere administrative environment

`MoRE` helps the existing `WAS ND` Clients to run both existing `Java 8` and new `Java 17` applications using the same operating model. The same `WAS Admin Console` can be leveraged to manage the environment.

In the above diagram
- `DMgr Node` is a Deployment Manager node which runs on Java 8.
- `tWAS Node` is a node that contains tWAS server which runs on Java 8.
- `MoRE Node` is a node that contains `Managed Liberty Server`server which runs on Java 17.

## 2. Objective

The objective of this document is to explain the steps involved in deploying the following WAS ND architecture along with MoRE.
